## Tic Tac Toe in Tkinter

This is very dumb initial version of Tic Tac Toe.

There is no computer player and code is quick and dirty.

Just playing with Tkinter library here.

## Usage

```
python3 tictactoe.py
```

## TODO

- Add computer player...
- Cleanup the code
- Separate visuals from game logic
- Make it look nicer?
